# Design Standards

Standards for contributing design work to the Wylie Dog Design System. These apply whether you're designing a new component, updating an existing one, or reviewing a contribution.

---

## Component Anatomy

Every component must include a clearly defined anatomy:

| Part | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Base component | Default state, no interaction |
| Variants | All visual styles (e.g. Primary, Secondary, Outline, Ghost) |
| Sizes | Small, Medium, Large where applicable |
| States | Default, Hover, Focus, Active, Disabled |
| Optional parts | Clearly marked as optional (e.g. icon slots) |

**Example — Button anatomy:**

```
Button
├── Container (required)
├── Label (required)
└── Icon (optional — left, right, or icon-only)
```

---

## Naming Conventions

### Component Names

- **Descriptive over stylistic**: "Primary Button" not "Blue Button"
- **Consistent across parts**: "Card Header" / "Card Content" / "Card Footer" — not "Card Header" / "Card Body"
- **No implementation details**: "Elevated Card" → "Card"; "Card with Drop Shadow" ❌
- **Standard terminology**: "Disabled" not "Inactive" or "Greyed Out"

### Variant Names

Match the code API exactly. The design system uses these standard values:

| Property | Values |
|---|---|
| `variant` | `default`, `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `destructive`, `link` |
| `size` | `sm`, `md`, `lg` |
| `state` | `default`, `hover`, `focus`, `active`, `disabled` |

If a new component needs variant names not listed here, align with engineering before finalizing.

## Token Usage

All designs must use semantic design tokens — never hardcoded values:

```
✅ Use: color.background.primary    ❌ Don't: #FFFFFF
✅ Use: color.text.brand            ❌ Don't: #2563EB
✅ Use: spacing.4 (16px)           ❌ Don't: 16px
✅ Use: typography.body.medium      ❌ Don't: 16px Inter Regular
```

Refer to the [Theming Overview](/story/resources-theming-overview--docs) for the full token hierarchy and semantic token names.

## Accessibility Standards

### Color Contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA)

| Text type | Minimum ratio |
|---|---|
| Normal text (< 18px) | 4.5:1 |
| Large text (≥ 18px or 14px bold) | 3:1 |
| UI components and boundaries | 3:1 |

### Focus States

All interactive elements must have a visible focus indicator:

- Minimum 2px outline
- 3:1 contrast ratio against the background
- Clearly distinguishable from hover and active states

### Touch Targets

- Mobile: 44×44px minimum (iOS) / 48×48px (Android)
- Desktop: 24×24px minimum
- 8px minimum spacing between adjacent targets

---

## Responsive Design

Design mobile-first at these breakpoints:

| Name | Width |
|---|---|
| Mobile | 375px–767px |
| Tablet | 768px–1023px |
| Desktop | 1024px–1439px |
| Large | 1440px+ |

Use the 4px base spacing scale. Prefer Tailwind spacing tokens (`space-4` = 16px, `space-6` = 24px, etc.) when annotating specs for engineering.

---

## Asset Export

### Icons

- Format: SVG
- Size: 24×24px
- Color: `currentColor`
- Naming: `icon-name.svg` (kebab-case)

### Images

- Format: WebP (PNG fallback)
- Export: @1x, @2x, @3x
- Naming: descriptive, kebab-case, compressed before committing

## Handoff Checklist

Before marking a design ready for development:

- [ ] All component variants and states are complete
- [ ] Design tokens used throughout (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] All interactive states designed (hover, focus, active, disabled)
- [ ] Spacing annotated using token names
- [ ] Typography specs reference token names, not raw values
- [ ] Color annotations use token names, not hex
- [ ] WCAG AA contrast verified for all text and UI elements
- [ ] Focus states visible and meet 3:1 contrast
- [ ] Touch targets meet minimum size requirements
- [ ] Responsive behavior documented for all breakpoints
- [ ] Layer/component naming is clean and consistent
- [ ] Assets exported at correct sizes (if applicable)
