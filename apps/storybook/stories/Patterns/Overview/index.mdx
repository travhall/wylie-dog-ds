# Patterns

Patterns are multi-component solutions that solve common design and development challenges. Unlike individual components, patterns show how to combine multiple elements to create complete, functional interfaces.

## What Are Patterns?

**Components** are individual building blocks (like Button, Input, or Card).

**Patterns** are proven solutions that combine multiple components to solve specific problems (like a login form, data table with filters, or multi-step wizard).

## When to Use Patterns

Use patterns when you need to:

- **Solve common problems** - Don't reinvent the wheel for well-established UI patterns
- **Ensure consistency** - Apply the same solution across your application
- **Save time** - Start with a working solution instead of building from scratch
- **Follow best practices** - Benefit from tested, accessible implementations

## Pattern Categories

### Form Patterns

Complete form solutions including layout, validation, and error handling.

**Examples:**
- Form layouts (single column, multi-column, wizard)
- Validation and error handling strategies
- Multi-step forms with progress indicators

**Use when:** Building any form-based interface, from simple contact forms to complex multi-step wizards.

### Authentication Patterns

User authentication and account management flows.

**Examples:**
- Login and registration forms
- Password recovery workflows
- Social authentication integration

**Use when:** Implementing user authentication, account creation, or password management.

### Data Patterns

Solutions for displaying, filtering, and interacting with data.

**Examples:**
- Sortable and filterable tables
- Search interfaces with results
- Data loading and pagination strategies

**Use when:** Working with lists, tables, search results, or any data-heavy interfaces.

### Navigation Patterns

Application navigation and menu structures.

**Examples:**
- Primary and secondary navigation
- Responsive navigation (mobile/desktop)
- Breadcrumb implementations

**Use when:** Building app navigation, menus, or wayfinding systems.

## Patterns vs. Components vs. Examples

| | Components | Patterns | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Scope** | Single UI element | Multi-component solution | Complete page/flow |
| **Purpose** | Reusable building block | Solve specific problem | Show real-world usage |
| **Flexibility** | Highly customizable | Customizable within constraints | Inspirational reference |
| **Example** | Button | Login form | Full dashboard page |

## How to Use Patterns

1. **Identify your need** - What problem are you trying to solve?
2. **Find the pattern** - Browse the category that matches your need
3. **Review the solution** - Understand the pattern's structure and behavior
4. **Adapt to your context** - Customize the pattern for your specific requirements
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure the pattern works in your application

## Pattern Documentation Structure

Each pattern includes:

- **Problem statement** - What challenge this pattern solves
- **Solution overview** - High-level approach and key components used
- **Implementation** - Complete, working code examples
- **Variations** - Common adaptations and alternatives
- **Accessibility** - WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation
- **Best practices** - Do's and don'ts

## Contributing Patterns

Have a pattern you've used successfully? Consider contributing it back to the design system.
